# Idea
[juniorAlphabet](http://junioralphabet.ironcoders.com/) is a platform dedicated to primary school pupils that facilitates learning of the Romanian language through gamification.

Each lesson is represented by one hero, so children will be attracted by these elements.

Moreover, once the theoretical part is understood, the student can complete a mini-test and if the result is satisfactory, he will receive a new hero to his own collection, thus being rewarded for his effort.

The platform is divided into the following modules:
* login / registration 
* profile
* heroes & lessons
